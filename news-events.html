                          <p> <strong>Wayne, PA December 15, 2015</strong>: LiquidHub, a digital transformation company providing customer engagement and technology solutions to global corporations, and <a href="http://unifisoftware.com/" target="_blank">UNIFi Software</a>, the only comprehensive, data integration solution for the enterprise, today announced they have entered into a partnership. </p>
                          <p> With the UNIFI solution built on the Hadoop platform, LiquidHub will work with customers to establish an environment where IT departments maintain control of the data to ensure rules are implemented, security is in place, and accessibility requirements are maintained. Once UNIFi is installed, business analysts are able to gather information from any data source available to them, combine and filter data sets, augment data and derive new attributes as necessary, and deliver those results to their visualization tool for easy reference without relying on IT programming resources. This self-serve analysis capability dramatically reduces the volume of IT requests and enables business analysts to acquire data-based insights almost instantly, while still maintaining data integrity and security—especially important in highly regulated industries, such as healthcare and financial services. </p>
                          <p> “UNIFi delivers the most advanced data integration solution available on the Hadoop platform,” said Thomas Hannigan, Partner, Life Sciences at LiquidHub. “At LiquidHub, we are always investigating tools that help businesses operate faster and smarter, while maintaining the highest levels of data security and control. I know this is critical in the life sciences industry where patient information must be managed in a way that retains the strictest levels of privacy, but security is something that is paramount across all industries. UNIFi’s solution leads in all functionality categories and we are looking forward to working together.” </p>
                          <p> “This partnership is advancing the democratization of information across organizations through complementary services,” said Rob Carlson, CEO and co-founder of UNIFi. “The services LiquidHub provides are critical to helping corporations quickly establish an environment that meets their business and IT needs, while ensuring connectivity, security and efficiency. We are excited to move forward and deliver solutions to companies in all sectors a new, faster way to make informed business decisions.” </p>

                          <p> <strong>About UNIFi Software</strong><br>
                            UNIFi was founded with a mission of solving the ubiquitous data acquisition and integration problem that has plagued enterprises since the dawn of data warehousing. The landscape of data analysis that enterprises are embarking on today has significantly advanced in just a few years’ time. The days of building an enterprise data warehouse to report on financial status or sales over time is no longer a competitive advantage; in today’s world doing this well is now considered a cost of doing business. The core problem that has arisen in this new era of analytics is business users have not been enabled to participate in the most critical part of the process that has the biggest impact on time to insight. With the advent of the Hadoop data storage and processing platform this has created a unique opportunity to build an application that enables the business to acquire data, integrate it, enrich it, and load it into a flexible environment where agile and iterative analytics can occur. </p>
                          <p> UNIFi has built a first-of-its-kind business application that combines Big Data integration processing layered with an elegant and simple user experience that dramatically increases productivity and time to insight. </p>

                          <p> <strong>Wayne, PA December 9, 2015</strong>: LiquidHub, a digital transformation company providing customer engagement and technology solutions to global corporations, announced today that it has significantly enhanced its digital agency capabilities, expanding into new geographies and new services. </p>
                          <p> As a Digital Integrator, LiquidHub has been combining great user experience with world-class technology execution, and now is refining that role as clients look for a new kind of digital agency and technology partner. LiquidHub’s long expertise in Enterprise Architecture and deep roots in complex technology execution, coupled with deep vertical industry domain expertise and a sense for the customer journey, bring a different perspective to clients as they seek to more effectively engage customers across channels. </p>
                          <p> “As our clients have demanded a single voice to speak for their customers—from experience to enablement—LiquidHub has responded as their digital customer engagement partner. With the recent addition of the former THINK Interactive leadership in Atlanta to LiquidHub’s existing digital agency capabilities, we believe we represent our clients’ Next-Generation Digital Agency,” LiquidHub CEO Jonathan Brassington said. “The CMO and the CIO need a single partner who they can rely on to deliver great strategy and experience and then execute on that across all channels, to customers anywhere regardless of technical complexity. That’s why they turn to LiquidHub.” </p>
                          <p> “Digital Transformation is only possible when you can both set the strategy and design the experience, then help clients execute on it. The LiquidHub team can do what most digital agencies can not: deliver on the customer engagement process end to end,” said Will DuPont, former President of THINK Interactive, now Partner at LiquidHub. “Great creative is not enough. The 21st century consumer needs a seamless experience, and that’s incredibly hard to deliver. That’s what LiquidHub has built.” </p>
                          <p> LiquidHub, over the last few months has been steadily investing in building its Digital Agency capabilities. Ranked by Forbes as one of America’s most promising companies, LiquidHub also recently hired Hank Summy, the former MRM/McCann and SapientNitro leader, to head the company’s vertical markets. Earlier this year, a commissioned Thought Leadership Paper by Forrester Consulting revealed the need for a different breed of Digital Agency partners who can deliver integrated customer journey solutions. </p>

                            WAYNE, PA - September 10, 2015</strong> </p>
                          <hr>
                          <p> </p>
                          <p> LiquidHub, the digital transformation company providing customer engagement and technology solutions to global corporations announced today the launch of its new brand identity and refreshed positioning in the marketplace. </p>
                          <p> In its renewed positioning, LiquidHub focuses on building innovative solutions that not only provide a substantive and personalized user experience in the front end, but also building and integrating applications and systems in the back end. LiquidHub’s rebranding comes at a time when integrated customer journey solutions are taking center stage emphasized in a recent commissioned Forrester Consulting Thought Leadership Paper titled ‘Executing Digital Transformation: How to Pick the Right Partner for Success’<sup>1</sup>. </p>
                          <p> “Companies undergoing a digital transformation need an end-to-end partner to help create an engaging customer experience, build the right technological foundation to support it, and enable the integration into existing technologies and systems,” according to the study. For this thought leadership paper, Forrester conducted an online survey of 150 enterprise organizations in the U.S. that were engaged in some of level of digital delivery and transformation with at least one outside partner. Nearly half of the respondents belonged to the C-suite while around 90 percent of them were decision makers. The study revealed the following key findings: </p>
                          <p> “<strong>Changing customer expectations means continuous transformation for digital engagement.</strong> Even with all the proper channels in place, digital engagement with customers is more a journey than it is a destination. With the rapid advancements of technology, companies seek to continually reinvent themselves and find new ways to engage with their customers via digital channels. </p>
                          <p> <strong>Customer engagement demands end-to-end integration among channels and across the value chain.</strong> Expanding the availability of channels for both digital and digitally enabled customer interactions can drive benefit to the business. But failure to integrate data across channels creates poor customer experience. </p>
                          <p> <strong>Effectively building improved digital engagements requires a full service, end-to-end partner.</strong> Having a single partner for digital transformation services, for both application delivery and integration, enables more streamlined implementations by eliminating the logistical challenges of working with multiple partners. Today’s digital channels have to interface with data, information, and insights across the value chain, creating a complexity that a small number of partners can best address.” </p>
                          <p> “Corporations today are constantly faced with the challenge of managing multiple and siloed partners for their digital transformation needs. Our proven experience in handling systems and application integration in the back-end coupled with our user experience and customer journey expertise allows us to offer innovative solutions to clients that facilitate strategy and seamless technology execution, and provide their end customers with a spectacular experience.” <strong>said, Jonathan Brassington, LiquidHub Co-founder and CEO, announcing the brand re-launch.</strong> “With our refreshed positioning, we offer end-to-end solutions blending our expertise in user experience with technology services across the financial services, healthcare, life sciences, insurance, and commercial &amp; retail industries.” </p>
                          <p> The company’s redesigned logo features a new typeface with a unique design formed by two entwined infinity symbols representing user experience and technology solutions and the endless possibilities that transform customer engagement. </p>

                          <p> Services providers with design, business consulting, and industry expertise will be best positioned to help you with early decisions about what to create and how to create it. When you do not have a technology picked, you will get the best advice from partners who do not have (too much) skin in the game. Nearly all strategy and business consultants will have some bias since most do some sort of implementation work in this space and partner with some leading cloud providers. Top business consultants — like Accenture, Deloitte, KPMG, and PwC — are well positioned to advise you on strategy and road map, and they partner with several major cloud technology suppliers. That said, if you have already fallen in love with a specific cloud platform, like AWS, Google, or Salesforce, you might favor working with a more focused consultant — such as Appirio or LiquidHub for Salesforce-based solutions or CI&amp;T or Cloud Sherpas for solutions based on Google platforms. </p>

                          <p> Threats and opportunities are not limited to customer-facing applications. Empowered consumers have rewritten the terms of engagement in the healthcare industry. Insurance brokers no longer live in a world of captive consumers, where success meant convincing a business' HR department that their proposal was good for the corporate bottom line. Now the plan must appeal to employees as well. A major healthcare insurer improved its sales effectiveness by equipping its independent brokers with an iPad application that presented financial models and analyzed alternatives from the employee's perspective. </p>

                          <p> A webinar featuring Bobby Cameron Forrester’s Vice President and Principal Analyst. </p>
                          <p> Digital customer engagement sits at the core of digital transformation -- for both B2B and B2C companies. In a recent six-year study, publicly-traded companies that have mastered customer engagement, measured by Forrester’s Customer Experience Index (CX Index™), outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index by a factor of three. </p>
                          <p> But customer engagement is complex, and only 10% of firms go at it alone, relying on multiple partners to drive their digital transformation. This partner landscape continues to change as specialized digital agencies fail to address the comprehensive, end-to-end requirements for delivering effective digital engagement across the customer journey. Technology development skills organic to next-gen SIs, such as a MobileFirst culture, DevOps, Agile, and Architecture expertise, are critical to customer engagement. Successful firms are now turning to partners who are able to provide integration, innovation, and implementation capabilities. </p>
                          <p> This Webinar will answer questions such as: </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>What factors are driving the focus on digital customer engagement?</li>
                            <li>Which challenges limit a firm’s ability to deliver this digital engagement?</li>
                            <li>What is the partner’s role in addressing these challenges?</li>
                            <li>What type are partners can effectively meet these challenges?</li>
                          </ul>

                          <p> Midsize providers enter the Salesforce market through M&amp;A. As the market shakes out, some smaller boutique options have disappeared, but new, larger choices now stand in their place. Midsize providers like Perficient and LiquidHub were not on buyers' radar screen for Salesforce a couple of years ago, but strategic acquisitions have changed that. Perficient's acquisition of CoreMatrix makes it larger and more experienced than many boutiques, as do the multiple acquisitions made by LiquidHub (such as Redkite). These firms are better suited to complex Salesforce deals than the standalone entities they have acquired because they can tap into a broad range of skills in other areas (such as custom development and mobile) that are increasingly relevant for Salesforce. </p>

                          <p> More than a thousand high school and college student programmers from all over the world converge in Philadelphia twice a year for a weekend of creating and learning. Hackathons are about coding together to solve real-world problems. Students work in teams of up to four people for thirty-six hours to create a web, mobile, or hardware application. A panel of professional judges will select the best three apps based on the following criteria: creativity, technical difficulty, polish, and usefulness. The winners will be annouced January 18th. </p>
