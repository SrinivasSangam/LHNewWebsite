                                <hr>
                                <p> <strong>PHILADELPHIA – December 1, 2016</strong> – LiquidHub, a customer engagement company, today announced its research sponsorship of a 12-part series with Knowledge@Wharton, an online business analysis journal for the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. The series, titled The Network Revolution, is authored by Barry Libert, Megan Beck, and Jerry (Yoram) Wind, professor of marketing at the Wharton School and director of Wharton’s SEI Center for Advanced Studies in Management. </p>
                                <p> The authors explore why companies, whose business models involve leveraging networks, generate more value than traditional firms as capital, talent, and customers are shifting towards network-centric organizations in this digital transformation age. </p>
                                <p> “Innovative companies building value in the 21st century economy need to understand how to move from delivering value from physical goods and people to delivering value through ideas and connectivity,” said Jonathan Brassington, CEO and co-founder of LiquidHub. “LiquidHub is proud to sponsor this series, which explores the kinds of transformations we help our clients achieve.” </p>
                                <p> In conjunction with the series, LiquidHub is proud to announce Professor Jerry Wind as the newest member of its Executive Advisory Board (EAB), comprised of highly respected entrepreneurs, strategists, investors, marketers, technologists and innovators. </p>
                                <p> Having lectured at more than 50 universities worldwide, Wind is internationally known for pioneering research on organizational buying behavior, market segmentation, conjoint analysis, and marketing strategy. Considered one of the most cited authors in marketing, Wind regularly contributes to professional marketing literature, which includes more than 25 books and over 300 research papers, articles and monographs. </p>
                                <p> Wind served as the founding editor of Wharton School Publishing, a joint venture with Pearson Education, and is the recipient of four major marketing awards, including the Charles Coolidge Parlin Award, the AMA/Irwin Distinguished Educator Award, the Paul D. Converse Award, and the Buck Weaver Award.He was also selected as one of the first nine “Legends in Marketing” by Sage Publishing, which published eight volumes of Wind’s work. </p>
                                <p> “The greatest challenge facing leaders in companies that want to benefit from these new market opportunities is figuring out how to transform from their current model into a networked organization that leverages today’s digital platforms,” said Wind. “We’re especially grateful for LiquidHub’s support of this series, given their commitment to providing digital transformation solutions for their clients. I’m proud to join their Executive Advisory Board to counsel on transformative strategies that have a meaningful impact on customer solutions.” </p>

                                <hr>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p> <strong>PHILADELPHIA</strong> – September 13, 2016 – LiquidHub, a customer engagement company, is proud to announce that the organization has been named as a 2016 <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/" target="_blank">Computerworld</a> Data+ Editors’ Choice Award honoree. This prestigious honor recognizes the top 20 innovative data initiatives that deliver significant business value. </p>
                                <p> LiquidHub was recognized for its partnership with a pharmaceutical manufacturer as it prepared to introduce a new distribution model which would generate large amounts of data around the patient journey. LiquidHub provided the necessary platform and technologies to de-identify patient data for better visibility into the patient experience, from the day patients receive a prescription and request a referral to the day they no longer take the medication. </p>
                                <p> Through LiquidAnalytics, LiquidHub’s specialty pharmaceutical data aggregation and analytics platform, the manufacturer was able to examine the data at the macro, big picture level, and also at the micro level, patient by patient. This solution allowed the manufacturer to truly understand the patient’s experience, enabling it to identify individual problems and intervene quickly to support a patient’s needs throughout his or her journey. </p>
                                <p> “We are proud of this achievement as it shows our commitment to providing innovative strategies that create impactful solutions for our clients,” said Thomas Hannigan, partner, Life Sciences at LiquidHub. “Our partners can be confident that we offer the best-in-class services and solutions, including encryption and de-identification technology which provide deeper insights to help clients improve the patient experience.” </p>
                                <p> “We are pleased to announce the 2016 Computerworld Data+ Editors’ Choice Awards honorees,” said Scot Finnie, editor in chief, Computerworld. “This year’s 20 winning organizations have used data analytics to achieve a wide spectrum of gains, from improving business profitability to uncovering trends in criminal activity and reducing energy use -- even keeping trains running on schedule. We're continually impressed with the new and inventive analytics projects at organizations big and small uncovered through our Data+ program. This year's winning organizations are at the forefront of applying data analytics to deliver both business and societal benefits.” </p>
                                <p> The Data+ Editors’ Choice Awards honorees and their achievements will be highlighted in a special September feature on <a href="http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/606669/takeda-pharmaceuticals/" target="_blank">Computerworld.com</a>. </p>

                            The Computerworld Data+ Editors’ Choice awards program was launched in 2013 by IDG’s Computerworld editorial team to recognize organizations that are mining big data to analyze and predict business trends and monetize this information. Organizations were asked to complete questionnaires detailing their big data projects, which were then reviewed by the Computerworld editorial team. From those questionnaires, honorees were selected for their ability to achieve business benefits through big data, and demonstrate real-world results and best practices.

                                <p> <strong>What is the vendor's partner ecosystem?</strong> Software vendors rely on an ecosystem of technology partnerships and systems integrators to make them successful. For example, The Bank of New York Mellon leveraged industry accelerators from the systems integrator LiquidHub to transform its CRM use from compliance-support processes to support for better client engagement. Ask questions about the depth and breadth of sales partners; delivery partners, which include a library of canned offerings for a particular industry; and customer service partners. Ask questions about the size of the partner community delivering plug-ins, extensions, or integrations to the base product and the way that it maintains these extensions over time. </p>

                                <p> <strong>PHILADELPHIA – August 12, 2016</strong> – LiquidHub, a customer engagement company, today announced the acquisition of <a href="http://electronicink.com/wrench/" target="_blank">Electronic Ink</a>, a human-centered design consultancy, with a client roster that includes such brand names as Penske, Morgan Stanley, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Ford Motor Company. With the addition of Electronic Ink, LiquidHub brings expanded design-thinking resources under one roof to deliver compelling customer experiences faster and at greater scale. </p>
                                <p> “Companies who enjoy the most successful business transformation solutions are those who go beyond examining customer preferences or patterns of behavior; they dig deeper to understand customers as people and study how they interact with technology,” said Jonathan Brassington, CEO of LiquidHub. “The addition of Electronic Ink’s research expertise will bring insights of human context to all aspects of our clients’ businesses. Having worked on assignments over the years with their talented team, I am thrilled to welcome them to our organization.” </p>
                                <p> Electronic Ink will strengthen LiquidHub’s digital marketing and creative capabilities, adding focused research on the human effect of technology on people. Their design skills allow them to create impactful visualizations that enable clients to easily understand the output of that research for greater ideation and solution development. Electronic Ink’s core competencies complement and integrate nicely with LiquidHub’s structured innovation solutions and customer engagement capabilities, providing even deeper insight into the human experience. </p>
                                <p> “Design that is rooted in human insight is foundational for success in today’s digitally-driven economy,” said Harold Hambrose, founder and CEO of Electronic Ink. “That foundation must be grounded in understanding the human effect on technology across the consumer ecosystem, including operations. That’s what we uniquely bring to LiquidHub and that’s what is so exciting – our ability to build on the already outstanding talents of a leader in the customer engagement space. The opportunities for our employees and clients on both sides are tremendous. I am thrilled to be joining the team.” </p>
                                <p> “I am proud of the groundbreaking work Electronic Ink has created and the reputation we have established over the course of our more than 25 years in the design industry,” said Joe Weiss, chairman of Electronic Ink. “I know this next chapter will be equally successful as we join forces with another industry leader dedicated to raising the bar on innovation and delivering human-centered solutions that help businesses become brand leaders.” </p>

                                <p> Digital technologies empower customers like never before. Customers’ expectations have wildly changed, and as a result, customer relationships with brands have also changed. The speed with which customers embrace new technologies and channels is only getting faster, blindsiding traditional firms that struggle to adapt and innovate. </p>
                                <p> Innovation makes the world a better place. New ideas, processes and products can propel us all — companies and consumers — to the next level of achievement. And beyond. Sounds big, right? It can be. But it doesn’t have to be overwhelming. </p>
                                <p> Organizations that put the customer at the center of their innovation initiatives will create real, measurable business results without breaking the bank. Conversely, brands that do not invest the time in innovation, or refuse to focus on the customer, will get left behind. </p>

                                <hr>

                                <p> <strong>WAYNE, PA. – April 05, 2016</strong> – LiquidHub, a digital transformation company providing customer engagement and technology solutions to global corporations, today announced that its Specialty Pharmaceutical data aggregation and analytics platform, LiquidAnalytics, has been integrated with <a href="http://msa.com/" target="_blank">Management Science Associates, Inc.’s (MSA)</a> encryption engine to de-identify patient level data and provide advanced patient longitudinal analytics. This unique technology enables pharmaceutical manufacturers to follow the entire patient journey—without access to any patient level data—as they move through the process of gaining access to therapy. </p>
                                <p> “Data security and privacy are critical issues in the healthcare space,” said Thomas Hannigan, partner, Life Sciences at LiquidHub. “Specialty pharmacies, and other patient service providers, can be confident that LiquidAnalytics is leveraging best-in-class encryption and de-identification technology to remain compliant with HIPAA regulations and to ensure the security of their patients’ information. As pharmaceutical manufacturers increase their focus on patient centricity, this technology allows for better visibility into the patient journey, and the ability to remove barriers to getting, and keeping patients on therapy.” </p>
                                <p> Using a proprietary process certified as compliant with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), LiquidAnalytics uses MSA technology to encrypt and apply a de-identified patient identifier. In the absence of this process, patient counts are inaccurate as movements across pharmacies appear as patient discontinuations and new starts. Identified patient level data is processed through the MSA engine on-premise at the pharmacies, providing manufacturers with a unique patient ID without the need for sharing patient data. This de-identification practice allows LiquidAnalytics to mitigate risk and streamline the process of sharing health data. </p>
                                <p> “MSA Life Sciences is proud to provide technologically advanced, trusted tools that help LiquidHub and their customers better understand patient needs,” said Tony Fontecchio, vice president, MSA Life Sciences Division. “Having the ability to de-identify and transform disparate healthcare data into anonymous, longitudinal, patient-level data supports the complex analytics and research initiatives that can ultimately help people lead healthier lives.” </p>

                                <p> <strong>WAYNE, PA. – February 23, 2016</strong> – LiquidHub, the digital transformation company providing customer engagement and technology solutions to global corporations, today announced its entry into the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals<sup>®</sup> (IAOP) 2016 Global Outsourcing 100<sup>®</sup> (GO100) List in the “Leaders Category”. The announcement marks LiquidHub’s inaugural recognition as one of the world’s best outsourcing service providers for operational excellence. </p>
                                <p> LiquidHub is being recognized by the IAOP<sup>®</sup> as one of the top 100 service providers from around the world in five distinct assessment categories: Size and Growth; Customer References; Delivery Excellence; Programs for Innovation; and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). </p>
                                <p> The recognition follows a year of consistent investments, innovation, growth, and expansion into new markets, including full service digital engagement capabilities built on global delivery models, to continue meeting customer needs in a fast-changing global economy. </p>
                                <p> “We are proud to be recognized by the IAOP<sup>®</sup> for our global outsourcing models, which remain one of our core business strategies,” said Jonathan Brassington, CEO of LiquidHub. Our global delivery framework allows our digital engagement and technology integration teams, based in the U.S., Europe, and India to deliver exemplary efficiencies and transformational outcomes to our clients. Our entry into the IAOP<sup>®</sup> list in the “Leaders category” further validates our success as a valued digital partner.” </p>
                                <p> Over the past 12 months, LiquidHub has been taking great strides in delivering value to its customers. It has expanded its presence with newer offices in Atlanta, New York City, and Boston, in the U.S., as well as global expansion in the Netherlands and India. As part of building customer engagement solutions, the company has launched several business accelerators that allow customers to derive sustainable business value. Earlier, a commissioned Thought Leadership Paper by Forrester Consulting revealed the need for a different breed of partner who can deliver these types of integrated customer journey solutions. </p>
                                <p> “Choosing the right partners is more important than ever. Companies that outsource, not only in the traditional sense, but also through the wide array of the ever-changing collaborative business models are scrutinizing their providers very closely,” said Debi Hamill, IAOP CEO. “The GO100 is the definitive guide to help companies research and compare service providers with whom they are considering relationships." </p>

Sharon Goldman asks Rajul to discuss the reality that mobile payment options are quickly replacing traditional payment options like credit cards and cash, as well as which options are here to stay. </p>
                                <p> He explains that their may be too many options for any of them to really take off. “Apple Pay hasn’t really taken off so far, nor have any of these mobile wallets taken off in a big, meaningful way,” Rana says </p>

                                <p> <strong>Wayne, PA December 15, 2015</strong>: LiquidHub, a digital transformation company providing customer engagement and technology solutions to global corporations, and <a href="http://unifisoftware.com/" target="_blank">UNIFi Software</a>, the only comprehensive, data integration solution for the enterprise, today announced they have entered into a partnership. </p>
                                <p> With the UNIFI solution built on the Hadoop platform, LiquidHub will work with customers to establish an environment where IT departments maintain control of the data to ensure rules are implemented, security is in place, and accessibility requirements are maintained. Once UNIFi is installed, business analysts are able to gather information from any data source available to them, combine and filter data sets, augment data and derive new attributes as necessary, and deliver those results to their visualization tool for easy reference without relying on IT programming resources. This self-serve analysis capability dramatically reduces the volume of IT requests and enables business analysts to acquire data-based insights almost instantly, while still maintaining data integrity and security—especially important in highly regulated industries, such as healthcare and financial services. </p>
                                <p> “UNIFi delivers the most advanced data integration solution available on the Hadoop platform,” said Thomas Hannigan, Partner, Life Sciences at LiquidHub. “At LiquidHub, we are always investigating tools that help businesses operate faster and smarter, while maintaining the highest levels of data security and control. I know this is critical in the life sciences industry where patient information must be managed in a way that retains the strictest levels of privacy, but security is something that is paramount across all industries. UNIFi’s solution leads in all functionality categories and we are looking forward to working together.” </p>
                                <p> “This partnership is advancing the democratization of information across organizations through complementary services,” said Rob Carlson, CEO and co-founder of UNIFi. “The services LiquidHub provides are critical to helping corporations quickly establish an environment that meets their business and IT needs, while ensuring connectivity, security and efficiency. We are excited to move forward and deliver solutions to companies in all sectors a new, faster way to make informed business decisions.” </p>

                                <p> <strong>About UNIFi Software</strong><br>
                            UNIFi was founded with a mission of solving the ubiquitous data acquisition and integration problem that has plagued enterprises since the dawn of data warehousing. The landscape of data analysis that enterprises are embarking on today has significantly advanced in just a few years’ time. The days of building an enterprise data warehouse to report on financial status or sales over time is no longer a competitive advantage; in today’s world doing this well is now considered a cost of doing business. The core problem that has arisen in this new era of analytics is business users have not been enabled to participate in the most critical part of the process that has the biggest impact on time to insight. With the advent of the Hadoop data storage and processing platform this has created a unique opportunity to build an application that enables the business to acquire data, integrate it, enrich it, and load it into a flexible environment where agile and iterative analytics can occur. </p>
                                <p> UNIFi has built a first-of-its-kind business application that combines Big Data integration processing layered with an elegant and simple user experience that dramatically increases productivity and time to insight. </p>

                                <p> As a Digital Integrator, LiquidHub has been combining great user experience with world-class technology execution, and now is refining that role as clients look for a new kind of digital agency and technology partner.

                                <p> “As our clients have demanded a single voice to speak for their customers—from experience to enablement—LiquidHub has responded as their digital customer engagement partner. With the recent addition of the former THINK Interactive leadership in Atlanta to LiquidHub’s existing digital agency capabilities, we believe we represent our clients’ Next-Generation Digital Agency,” LiquidHub CEO Jonathan Brassington said. “The CMO and the CIO need a single partner who they can rely on to deliver great strategy and experience and then execute on that across all channels, to customers anywhere regardless of technical complexity. That’s why they turn to LiquidHub.” </p>
                                <p> “Digital Transformation is only possible when you can both set the strategy and design the experience, then help clients execute on it. The LiquidHub team can do what most digital agencies can not: deliver on the customer engagement process end to end,” said Will DuPont, former President of THINK Interactive, now Partner at LiquidHub. “Great creative is not enough. The 21st century consumer needs a seamless experience, and that’s incredibly hard to deliver. That’s what LiquidHub has built.” </p>
                                <p> LiquidHub, over the last few months has been steadily investing in building its Digital Agency capabilities.

Earlier this year, a commissioned Thought Leadership Paper by Forrester Consulting revealed the need for a different breed of Digital Agency partners who can deliver integrated customer journey solutions. </p>

                                  WAYNE, PA - September 10, 2015</strong> </p>
                                <hr>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p> LiquidHub, the digital transformation company providing customer engagement and technology solutions to global corporations announced today the launch of its new brand identity and refreshed positioning in the marketplace. </p>
                                <p> In its renewed positioning, LiquidHub focuses on building innovative solutions that not only provide a substantive and personalized user experience in the front end, but also building and integrating applications and systems in the back end. LiquidHub’s rebranding comes at a time when integrated customer journey solutions are taking center stage emphasized in a recent commissioned Forrester Consulting Thought Leadership Paper titled ‘Executing Digital Transformation: How to Pick the Right Partner for Success’<sup>1</sup>. </p>
                                <p> “Companies undergoing a digital transformation need an end-to-end partner to help create an engaging customer experience, build the right technological foundation to support it, and enable the integration into existing technologies and systems,” according to the study. For this thought leadership paper, Forrester conducted an online survey of 150 enterprise organizations in the U.S. that were engaged in some of level of digital delivery and transformation with at least one outside partner. Nearly half of the respondents belonged to the C-suite while around 90 percent of them were decision makers. The study revealed the following key findings: </p>
                                <p> “<strong>Changing customer expectations means continuous transformation for digital engagement.</strong> Even with all the proper channels in place, digital engagement with customers is more a journey than it is a destination. With the rapid advancements of technology, companies seek to continually reinvent themselves and find new ways to engage with their customers via digital channels. </p>
                                <p> <strong>Customer engagement demands end-to-end integration among channels and across the value chain.</strong> Expanding the availability of channels for both digital and digitally enabled customer interactions can drive benefit to the business. But failure to integrate data across channels creates poor customer experience. </p>
                                <p> <strong>Effectively building improved digital engagements requires a full service, end-to-end partner.</strong> Having a single partner for digital transformation services, for both application delivery and integration, enables more streamlined implementations by eliminating the logistical challenges of working with multiple partners. Today’s digital channels have to interface with data, information, and insights across the value chain, creating a complexity that a small number of partners can best address.” </p>
                                <p> “Corporations today are constantly faced with the challenge of managing multiple and siloed partners for their digital transformation needs. Our proven experience in handling systems and application integration in the back-end coupled with our user experience and customer journey expertise allows us to offer innovative solutions to clients that facilitate strategy and seamless technology execution, and provide their end customers with a spectacular experience.” <strong>said, Jonathan Brassington, LiquidHub Co-founder and CEO, announcing the brand re-launch.</strong> “With our refreshed positioning, we offer end-to-end solutions blending our expertise in user experience with technology services across the financial services, healthcare, life sciences, insurance, and commercial &amp; retail industries.” </p>
                                <p> The company’s redesigned logo features a new typeface with a unique design formed by two entwined infinity symbols representing user experience and technology solutions and the endless possibilities that transform customer engagement. </p>

                                <p> Services providers with design, business consulting, and industry expertise will be best positioned to help you with early decisions about what to create and how to create it. When you do not have a technology picked, you will get the best advice from partners who do not have (too much) skin in the game. Nearly all strategy and business consultants will have some bias since most do some sort of implementation work in this space and partner with some leading cloud providers. Top business consultants — like Accenture, Deloitte, KPMG, and PwC — are well positioned to advise you on strategy and road map, and they partner with several major cloud technology suppliers. That said, if you have already fallen in love with a specific cloud platform, like AWS, Google, or Salesforce, you might favor working with a more focused consultant — such as Appirio or LiquidHub for Salesforce-based solutions or CI&amp;T or Cloud Sherpas for solutions based on Google platforms. </p>

                            <li>The customer journey and the path to customer experience excellence for the future.</li>
                            <li><strong>The "centricity model</strong>": brand centric -&gt; customer-centric: Expectations have changed. The customer has more control, and therefore building value and value add is ever more important.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sales reps are now a "channel"</strong>: As we move away from a sales rep-centric business model, we must now orchestrate and integrate all channels.</li>
                            <li><strong>The role of data insights</strong>: The industry has been able to collect and aggregate vast sums of data. However, how pharma/medical device companies can utilize and leverage this data/information in a meaningful way is now an obstacle. How do you determine what is valuable and how do you convert valuable information into insight and action?</li>
                            <li><strong>Performance accountability</strong>: In the ever-evolving healthcare landscape, there is increasing pressure on budgets and higher expectations from senior management to demonstrate ROI.</li>

                                <p> Threats and opportunities are not limited to customer-facing applications. Empowered consumers have rewritten the terms of engagement in the healthcare industry. Insurance brokers no longer live in a world of captive consumers, where success meant convincing a business' HR department that their proposal was good for the corporate bottom line. Now the plan must appeal to employees as well. A major healthcare insurer improved its sales effectiveness by equipping its independent brokers with an iPad application that presented financial models and analyzed alternatives from the employee's perspective. </p>

                                <p> A webinar featuring Bobby Cameron Forrester’s Vice President and Principal Analyst. </p>
                                <p> Digital customer engagement sits at the core of digital transformation -- for both B2B and B2C companies. In a recent six-year study, publicly-traded companies that have mastered customer engagement, measured by Forrester’s Customer Experience Index (CX Index™), outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index by a factor of three. </p>
                                <p> But customer engagement is complex, and only 10% of firms go at it alone, relying on multiple partners to drive their digital transformation. This partner landscape continues to change as specialized digital agencies fail to address the comprehensive, end-to-end requirements for delivering effective digital engagement across the customer journey. Technology development skills organic to next-gen SIs, such as a MobileFirst culture, DevOps, Agile, and Architecture expertise, are critical to customer engagement. Successful firms are now turning to partners who are able to provide integration, innovation, and implementation capabilities. </p>
                                <p> This Webinar will answer questions such as: </p>
                                <ul>
                            <li>What factors are driving the focus on digital customer engagement?</li>
                            <li>Which challenges limit a firm’s ability to deliver this digital engagement?</li>
                            <li>What is the partner’s role in addressing these challenges?</li>
                            <li>What type are partners can effectively meet these challenges?</li>
                          </ul>

                                <p> Midsize providers enter the Salesforce market through M&amp;A. As the market shakes out, some smaller boutique options have disappeared, but new, larger choices now stand in their place. Midsize providers like Perficient and LiquidHub were not on buyers' radar screen for Salesforce a couple of years ago, but strategic acquisitions have changed that. Perficient's acquisition of CoreMatrix makes it larger and more experienced than many boutiques, as do the multiple acquisitions made by LiquidHub (such as Redkite). These firms are better suited to complex Salesforce deals than the standalone entities they have acquired because they can tap into a broad range of skills in other areas (such as custom development and mobile) that are increasingly relevant for Salesforce. </p>
